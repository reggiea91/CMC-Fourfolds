Computation of output of Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal for 124 smooth projective toric Fano fourfolds 


"CMC_Summer_Project__Bondal_s_Numerical_Criterion (1).pdf"
This contains the output of the Sage computation of checking whether Bondal's numerical criterion coincides with the success of the Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal for smooth projective toric Fano fourfolds, using the polymake database classification of smooth projective toric Fano varieties via smooth reflexive lattice polytopes. Commented inline to understand computations listed there. 

"GitHub_Fourfolds_Repository.pdf" Contains the output of the check in Macaulay2 on the success of the Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal to yield a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles for each of the 124 smooth projective toric Fano fourfolds.
