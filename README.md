Computation of output of Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal for 124 smooth projective toric Fano fourfolds 


"CMC_Summer_Project__Bondal_s_Numerical_Criterion (1).pdf"
This contains the output of the Sage computation of checking whether Bondal's numerical criterion coincides with the success of the Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal for smooth projective toric Fano fourfolds, using the polymake database classification of smooth projective toric Fano varieties via smooth reflexive lattice polytopes. Computations to reproduce these results given in "SageNumer4folds...html"

"GitHub_Fourfolds_Repository.pdf" Contains the output of the check in Macaulay2 on the success of the Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal to yield a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles for each of the 124 smooth projective toric Fano fourfolds. 

"SageNumer4folds.sagews...html": Sage check of whether Bondal's numerical criterion coincides with success of Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal. Commented inline, but essentially uses a for loop to check the intersection product describing Bondal's numerical criterion.
